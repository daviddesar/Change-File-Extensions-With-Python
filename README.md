# Change Files's Extension Using Python Scripts
I write this Python file to do the process of changing many of files's extension instead of renaming each of them which is very time-consuming and boring.
You can change the files extension by running this script and following these simple steps below:
- Choose your destination folder containing your files 
- Fill in the current files's extension
- Click `Scan Files` to see the current number of files in the directory
- Fill in your extension you want to change to in the next text box
- And finally click `Convert!`
## Libraries I used in this file:
- `tkinter` : I use tkinter to make the GUI and make the app visible and easier to use.
- `glob` : glob library helps me to define the extension-type files in the directory and scan them.
- `os` : This library helps me to interact with the operating system (choose and change the current working directory and rename files).

### Note:
I hit some problems with the convertion to exe file. I tried using converter from google search results but there are still some errors and I cannot run the converted exe file. If you have any solution to my problem, please contact me. Thank you very much.
